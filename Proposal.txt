Project Description:

We plan to create a 3D pool game (We promise we came up with this idea before lab 11). It will feature standard pool balls, a custom physics engine, and an animated arm to manipulate the cue. Two users will interact with the program by
controlling the cue to hit the cue ball. We also plan to have background models which place the game somewhere on Mines
campus.

The balls will be textured for coloring and indentifying the type of ball. textures will also be used for the pool table and environment around it. 

Multiple cameras will be used to allow the player to rotate the camera around the scene, veiw the scene from a top down view, and get a close up on the cue to light up a shot. 

The shaders will use a custom implementation of toon shading. We will convert the rgb output after lighting to hsv, and then round the value component to create a stepped coloring. We may also include rim lighting. This shading setup will make the game have a unique art style. For the second shader, we plan on giving the cue ball a special shader that will utilize vertex deformation based on the location of contact with the pool cue.

We will use multiple types of lighting, including a dim directional light, and a prominent spotlight for creating a moody feel to the game, like a billiards bar. We may also put a dim point light on the cue ball.

The player arm will be animated and the balls will roll. Additionally, the spot light will be animated as if it is swinging slightly.
